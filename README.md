#Wargames#

A wargame (or war game) in hacking is a security challenge in which one must exploit or defend a vulnerability in a system or application or gain or prevent access to a computer system.

A wargame usually involves semantic URL attacks, knowledge-based authentication, password cracking, reverse engineering of software (mostly JavaScript, Adobe Flash, and assembly language), code injection, SQL injections, cross-site scripting, exploits, IP address spoofing, and other hacking techniques.
